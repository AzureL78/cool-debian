# cool-debian
A script for Ubuntu and Debian that grabs a sound clip of me saying "Cool." and makes an executable to run it.
The script:
-makes a directory called Cool in the user's home directory,
-installs VLC and Wget
-installs the MP3 and the script that runs it into the cool dir,
-and links the script to /bin for easy access.

To install, invoke this script:

*curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureL78/cool-debian/main/install.sh | bash*

You can uninstall with uninstall_cool.
